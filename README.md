###Strategy :

Background:
	
	I attended summer camp for two months every summer from the age of 7 until I was 14. 

	It was an all boys camp, located in Maine. I loved it. I'm lucky I was able to go. 

	My summers were a time for me to explore and begin forging my own character. Summer camp was an important platform for building character. A place to practice values-driven living. 

			
			Like Higher Ed, Summer Camp is problematically expensive.
			
			Unlike Higher Ed, Summer Camp is not generally viewed as critical to one's success.
			
			Therefore, Summers are Educationally Underutilized. 
			
			Moreover, Summer Camp provides space to be less test-driven / goal-oriented than school, without sacrificing positive outcomes. 
			
			I see opportunity for Growth In Ways That Matter


	Next Year. Continued Development of Web Skills > Build Out OSSC Web Functionality > Can the web :

		1: Drive Interest and Involvement
		2: Raise Capital Funds

		Skills Necessary:
			Carpentry
