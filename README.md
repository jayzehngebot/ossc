# Camp Rook and Camp Able
## Open-Source Summer Camp  (OSSC)
------------------------------------------	

#### Summer Camp is great
#### But can it be better?

### 1. Can a low-cost overnight camp compete without compromising on staff, safety, facilities & equipment?
### 2. Can OSSC excel at creative-engagement, providing opportunities for ownership, and experiential education?
### 3. Can OSSC model a batter balance of intellect and athleticism?

## What would Summer Camp for Future Makers look like?

* Kids Participate in Building The Camp, Physically and Conceptually.
* Targets the "hobbyist" niche under-served by traditional / sports-oriented summer camps.
* Serves a diverse and growing general population, not just the well-to-do.
* Off-Grid / Net-Positive / Self-Sustaining
* Food Conscious

## Addressing Michael Porter's Five Factors 
1. Technology Changes - Better Positioned to build foundation on newly accessible tools.
2. Regulation is not the concern, Insurance is the concern?
3. Competition - Feels like "Ripe For Disruption" territory. Serves its core audience, neglects growing, low-cost market. Business-as-usual approach.
4. Environmental and natural resources - Sustainability Baked In.
5. Human Capital - My experience is that of a great and growing pool.
aka I Know A Ton of smart, skillful, stand-up, responsible, stupidly underemployed people.

#  Strategy

------------------------------------------

##  Background :
	
I attended summer camp for two months every summer from the age of 7 until I was 14. It was an all boys camp, located in Maine. I loved it. I'm lucky I was able to go. 
My summers were a time for me to explore and begin forging my own character. Summer camp was an important platform for building character and practicing values.

------------------------------------------			
		
##  Landscape: 

Like Higher Ed, Summer Camp is problematically expensive.
			
Unlike Higher Ed, Summer Camp is not generally viewed as critical to one's success.
			
Therefore, For too many kids, summers are squandered.
			
Moreover, Summer Camp provides space to be less test-driven / goal-oriented than school, without sacrificing positive outcomes. 
			
I See Opportunity for Real Change & Individual Growth In Ways That Matter

## Timeline

####Working at WSJ and Teaching Small Web Class this Summer.
	
Building the Following Capabilities :
1. Platform Development
2: Market Engagement
3. Respectable Resume

#### Next Year. Work hard and learn at ITP

#### Upon Graduation. Potentially Pursue ITP Resident Position > Continued Open Source Activity. Practice Teaching, Network Building, 
Continued exposure to changing landscape.

#### 3 Years Out : part time teaching a University-level new media / creative tech program. 
taking some design commissions and working on OSSC > Raising Capital, Building Identity, Generating Interest, Networking.

#### 5 Years Out : I am 33. A growing camp + farm exists, with access to water. We're heading into the second summer of OSSC, with 150% Enrollment. 

---------------------------------------------

## Moneys

Sliding Scale 1 - 3K per kid per summer - 2 Months total time. 

#### Envelope Math
Startup Capital : 1M? Land (~500k) , Tools, Resources, Development.
^ Admittedly, Somewhat out of my depth.

45 * 2000 90k / 18 = 5k 
5k per staff for a summer of work?

This is ~ 1/5th the Cost of current Summer Camp
