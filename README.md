# Camp Rook and Camp Able
## Open-Source Summer Camp  (OSSC)
------------------------------------------	

## Summer Camp is great
## But can it be better?

#### 1. Can a low-cost overnight camp compete without compromising on staff, safety, facilities & equipment?
#### 2. Can OSSC excel at creative-engagement, providing opportunities for ownership, and experiential education?
#### 3. Can OSSC model a batter balance of intellect and athleticism?

## What Could Summer Camp for Future Makers look like?

## Addressing Michael Porter's Five Factors 
1. Technology Changes - Better Positioned to build foundation on newly accessible tools.
2. Regulation is less a concern than insurance coverage?
3. Competition - Feels like "Ripe For Disruption" territory. i.e. Focused on serving its core market, to the neglect of growing low-cost market. Business-as-usual approach.
4. Environmental and natural resources - Sustainability Baked In.
5. Human Capital - My experience is that of a great and growing pool.
I know a ton of smart, skillful, responsible people who are good with kids and sadly underemployed.

#  Strategy

##  Background :
	
I attended summer camp for two months every summer from the age of 7 until I was 14. It was an all boys camp, located in Maine. I loved it. I'm lucky I was able to go. 
My summers were a time for me to explore and begin forging my own character. Summer camp was an important platform for building character and practicing values.

------------------------------------------			
		
##  Landscape: 

Like Higher Ed, Summer Camp is problematically expensive.
			
Unlike Higher Ed, Summer Camp is not generally viewed as critical to one's success.
			
Therefore, For too many kids, summers are squandered.
			
Moreover, Summer Camp provides space to be less test-driven / goal-oriented than school, without sacrificing positive outcomes. 
			
I See Opportunity for Real Change & Individual Growth In Ways That Matter

## Rough Moneys

Sliding Scale 1 - 3K per kid per summer - 2 Months total time. 

#### Envelope Math
Startup Capital : 1M? Land (~500k) , Tools, Resources, Development.
^ Admittedly, mostly making this up.

45 * 2000 90k / 18 = 5k 
5k per staff for a summer of work?

This is ~ 1/5th the Cost of current Summer Camp
