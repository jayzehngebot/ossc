###Strategy :

Background:
	
	I attended summer camp for two months every summer from the age of 7 until I was 14. 

	It was an all boys camp, located in Maine. I loved it. I'm lucky I was able to go. 

	My summers were a time for me to explore and begin forging my own character. Summer camp was an important platform for building character. A place to practice values-driven living. 

			Unfortunately, like school, Sleepaway Camp is problematically expensive, and not generally viewed as critical to one's success, like school (mostly) still is.

			Summer Camp provides the space and opportunity, however, do be less test-driven and goal-oriented than school, without sacrificing learning as an outcome. 

	Next Year. Continued Development of Web Skills > Build Out OSSC Web Functionality > Can the web :

		1: Drive Interest and Involvement
		2: Raise Capital Funds

		Skills Necessary:
			Carpentry
			Electrical Engineering
			Printshop
