## Michael Porter's Five Factors 
1. Technology changes - underutilized / outmoded
2. Regulation is not the concern, Insurance is the concern?
3. Competition - Feels like "Ripe For Disruption" territory

4. Environmental and natural resources - Sustainability Baked In

5. Human Capital - My experience is that of a great and growing pool.

### Strategy :

#### Background:
	
I attended summer camp for two months every summer from the age of 7 until I was 14. It was an all boys camp, located in Maine. I loved it. I'm lucky I was able to go. 
My summers were a time for me to explore and begin forging my own character. Summer camp was an important platform for building character. A place to practice values-driven living. 

------------------------------------------			
		
#### Landscape: 
			Like Higher Ed, Summer Camp is problematically expensive.
			
			Unlike Higher Ed, Summer Camp is not generally viewed as critical to one's success.
			
			Therefore, Summers go Underutilized. 
			
			Moreover, Summer Camp provides space to be less test-driven / goal-oriented than school, without sacrificing positive outcomes. 
			
			I See Opportunity for Real Change & Individual Growth In Ways That Matter

---------------------------------------------

### Timeline

		1: Drive Interest and Involvement
		2: Help Raise Capital Funds

		Skills Necessary:
			Carpentry
			Electrical Engineering
			Printshop
